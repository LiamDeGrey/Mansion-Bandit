Mansion Bandit

Mansion Bandit infinite is a multiplayer adventure game where YOU are the bandit. Competing against the other bandits (In multiplayer mode) you are rushing to take the best items to keep to yourself.

The inventory on each bandit is limited, meaning you must make multiple trips back to your own van where you can drop the goods you have collected already (saving them). The winner
at the end of the game is the bandit that has taken the most costly goods and totals the highest price of stolen goods from the mansion.

Be careful though, because on each new game the mansion does not seem the same as it did before...
